# Time-Series-Prediction-of-Road-sensor-dataset

Objective
-

Predicting parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a road sensor dataset which records data for various section of road in a span of 10 years.

Model used
-

Extra-trees regressor model has been used. This model uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. It uses a number of randomized decision trees. Using this model, the root mean square error lies between 0.25- 63.5
